This repository includes the code for implementing the aberration correction algorithm presented in the paper “Synthetic aperture holographic third harmonic generation microscopy”. 

The code is broken down into two scripts for the aberration correction method described in the paper. The first script implements our modified “DASH” aberration correction (see https://github.com/mollyamay/Dynamic-Adaptive-Scattering-Compensation-Holography for original source code for DASH). The second script step implements the nonlinear distortion operator aberration correction method. 

The code is written in MATLAB using version 2022a.
